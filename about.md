Hi, I’m John.

Thanks for stopping by! I’m keeping this blog as a space to share my thoughts while I work toward becoming a therapist. It’s a place for me to reflect on my experiences, work through what I’m learning, and navigate this big career shift.

For the past five years, I've worked as a software developer, and before that I designed lighting for theatre productions all over the country. Now, I'm back in school pursuing a master’s in mental health counseling, and I’m using this blog to help me reflect on that journey, think through what I’m discovering and share the ups and downs of navigating a big transition. My goal is to think out loud, be authentic, and make mistakes as I learn. Terrifying? Absolutely. But also exciting.

When I’m not studying or writing, you’ll probably find me cooking, playing Dungeons & Dragons, or hanging out with my partner and our two cats.
