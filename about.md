Hi, I’m John.

Thanks for stopping by! I’m keeping this blog as a space to share my thoughts while I work toward becoming a therapist. It’s a place for me to reflect on my experiences, work through what I’m learning, and navigate this big career shift. My goal is to allow myself to think out loud, be authentic, and make mistakes as I learn. What a terrifying concept!

For the past five years, I've worked as a software developer, and before that I designed lighting for theatre productions all over the country. Now, I'm going back to school to pursue a master’s in mental health counseling, and ultimatley to become a therapist. I’m excited to learn more about mental health and how I can help others navigate their own journeys.

When I’m not studying or writing, you’ll probably find me cooking, playing Dungeons & Dragons, or hanging out with my partner and our two cats.
